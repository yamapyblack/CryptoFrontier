CryptoFrontier is the Full On-chained Game by FrontierDAO.

## Intdoruction

These days, the Crypto world is growing rapidly and we hear words such as DAO, GameFi and Metaverse more and more often.

I believe that Crypto is going to change the world and I have been working with crypto for several years now, mainly in the field of gaming.
However, I believe that Full On-chained Game is essential to realize the Metaverse. 

## What is Full On-chained Game?

As the Full On-chained suggests, this is a game where all the data of the game is stored on-chain.

This is a game where not only the characters and lands, but also the characterâ€™s status, skills, battle results and even the battle logic are recorded on-chain.

In current Crypto games, only the characters and lands are NFT, but the core logic of the game is off-chain.
The aim of the Full On-chained Game is to uproot that part of the game and make it on-chain.

CryptoFrontier is the Full On-chained Game where you explore new frontiers and fight for supremacy.

Players develop their characters and explore new lands.
Alternatively, they can fight other players for their territories.

Battles will occur spontaneously in each region.
We do not expect to organize centralized tournaments.
This is the aim of Crypto Frontier, to be truly decentralized.

The results of the battle are recorded on-chain.
It is impossible to falsify your battle record and you cannot cheat.
